# Quality

Quality code does what it’s intended to do. Excellent code quality follows a consistent style, is easy to understand, is well documented, and can be tested. There are five pillars that support the software development life cycle:

* Readability
* Performance
* Maintainability
* Reliability/Resiliency
* Security

# Knowledge

Build a strong culture of documentation, communication and knowledge sharing. We’ll be able to work more asynchronously by storing our team knowledge in one central location for any of us to access at any time. Jot down frequently asked questions that you hear on chat or in email. These questions might sound like:

* How do I find...?
* What is the process for…?
* Who is responsible for... ?
* Does anyone know about…?
* Does anyone know where…?
