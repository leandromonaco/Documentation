## Lean Software Development

Eliminate waste in our software development process by applying the [5S Model](glossary.md#5s).

#### Goal-Oriented Ideas

- Remove legacy code that is no longer in use.
- Take time to separate the code and use the object oriented design approach you’ve heard so much about.
- Allow time for refactoring, clean the code up when you have the opportunity. Don’t forget to run your tests again!
- If your team doesn’t have a coding standard work to put one in place, don’t assume others will look at code for examples.
- Once the standards are in place paired programming and code reviews can ensure proper technique and also help develop the programmer’s skill set.

## Quality

Write quality code that does what it’s intended to do, follows a consistent style, is easy to understand, is well documented, and can be tested. 
Focus on readability, performance, maintainability, reliability/resiliency, and security.

#### Goal-Oriented Ideas

* Automation Testing
* Unit Testing
* Integration Testing
* Load Testing
* Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
* Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)
* Code Smells
* Production Support
* Post-mortem reviews
* Incident Management
* On-Call
* Logging
* Monitoring (SRE and Observability)
