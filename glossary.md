# 5S

5S is a method of organizing a workplace. Once 5S has been applied the area in which team members work is clean and organized.

- **Sort:** Sort through an area to find and eliminate waste. Waste may be actual trash or an item in the area that is not needed to complete the tasks in that area. 
- **Straighten:** Once the area has been sorted it should be organized and setup to flow in such a way that work is completed with as little waste as possible.  Waste in the way of time, if moving an item could save one minute and you perform that movement a 100 times per day the area is more efficient.
- **Shine:** Make sure that the area is always neat and tidy.
- **Standardize:** Put standards in place to ensure the put forth effort is maintained.
- **Sustain:** Ensure adherence to the policies and standards put in place.
