# JWT

A JWT is a set of claims (JSON property–value pairs) that together make up a JSON object. 

It consists of three parts:

1. Header: Consists of two properties: { "alg": "HS256", "typ": "JWT" }. alg is the algorithm that is used to encrypt the JWT.
2. Payload: This is where the data to be sent is stored; this data is stored as JSON property–value pairs.
3. Signature: This is created by encrypting, with the algorithm specified in the header: 
  (i) the base64Url-encoded header, 
  (ii) base64Url-encoded payload
  (iii) a secret (or a private key)

Format: {header}.{payload}.{signature}

# Encryption 

Symmetric key and asymmetric keys

A JWT can be encrypted using either a symmetric key (shared secret) or asymmetric keys (the private key of a private–public pair).

1. Symmetric key: Both encryption (JWT signing) and verification are done with the symmetric key—also known as the shared secret.
2. Asymmetric keys: The encryption (JWT signing) is done with the private key, and verification is done with the public key.
