# Email 1 (2 weeks prior to launch)

Hi team,

I’m excited to share that we’re giving each of you access to Stack Overflow for Teams, a secure and private place for you to share and find knowledge related to our technology and company. Instead of getting pinged through chat or email for information causing distractions, we’ll be able to work more asynchronously by storing our team knowledge in one central location for any of us to access at any time.

To help you get familiar, you can watch the following short videos:

How to ask and answer a question

How to write an Article

How to create a Collection

You can also check out this user guide on how to use Stack Overflow for Teams.

We’ll be releasing this company-wide on ___________ so be on the lookout for an invite!

In the meantime, start thinking about the most common questions you get asked - we’ll be asking you to transfer that knowledge into our brand new Stack Overflow for Team when we launch. More to come about this exciting addition to our tools tech stack!

Please let me know if you have any questions.

# Email 2 (1 week prior to launch)

Hi there,

As I’ve mentioned, we’re counting down the days to launch for Stack Overflow for Teams, and I’m asking you to take 30 minutes between now and then to gather some of the most frequently asked questions that you hear on chat or in email and jot them down. These questions might sound like:

How do I find...?

What is the process for…?

Who is responsible for... ?

Does anyone know about…?

Does anyone know where…?

When we launch next week, I’ll be asking you to share those questions - and the answers in our Team to get us started.

Thanks!

# Email 3 (Launch Day)

Hi there,

Each of you should have just received an invite to Stack Overflow for Teams / Each of you now has access to our own Stack Overflow for Teams.

As requested, please take some time today to ask and answer a question. Here’s how to do that:

    Start a new question draft

    Use the question as the title

    Draft the question in total in the body

    Click “Answer my own question” at the bottom of the page

    Include your answer

    Hit save

What if my question has already been asked/answered?

When you type your question in the title bar, you will see if any other related questions have been asked. If you notice this, click on the question that is populated and check to see if it has been answered. If not, please do so! Notice that you could add more context? Go ahead and add that!

What if I don’t know of any common questions?

There are bound to be at least a few questions that our chat channels or you personally get asked on a somewhat regular basis. Check back through your chat and email messages if you’re struggling to come up with something.

What else can I do within Teams?

    Have a question that you don’t know the answer to? Write it up, and let’s get you some answers!

    Upvote good questions and answers and use emojis to show your enthusiasm. 

    Create an Article. Longer-form content like project documentation, how-to guides, etc. can live in our Team, too - just copy and paste something that you already know exists, and everyone else will be able to access it.

# Email 4 (2 days post-launch)

Hi team,

Congrats! We’ve managed to ask ___ questions, provide _____ answers, and write ____ Articles. This is just the beginning - and we’re already off to a great start!

What can you do next to make sure that our knowledge community thrives?

    Make sure that you are asking questions in our Team.

    Follow and create tags to stay on top of new information.

    When you see someone asking questions in Slack/Microsoft Teams, use the integration to suggest that they ask the question in our Team instead.

    Continue to transport documents into Articles.

I’ll continue to keep you all updated on how our Team is growing on a regular basis, and in the meantime, if you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.

Thank you!
