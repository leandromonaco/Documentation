# Capacity Planning

# Definition of Ready (DOR)

* Independent (of all others).
* Negotiable (not a specific contract for features).
* Valuable (or vertical).
* Estimable (to a good approximation).
* Small (so as to fit within an iteration).
* Testable (in principle, even if there isnâ€™t a test for it yet).

# Definition of Done (DOD)

The Definition of Done creates transparency by providing everyone a shared understanding of what work was completed.

* Unit tests are passing.
* Automation tests are passing.
* Documentation is updated.
* The change is code reviewed via a pull request.
* Code is merged into the main branch.
* Testing is done by Testers.
